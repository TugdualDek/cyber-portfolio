# New Portfolio: A Digital Playground

During my academic stay in Wales, I had the opportunity to work on a personal project that I've been wanting to do for a long time: completely redesigning my portfolio website. I decided to challenge myself by learning and implementing a modern tech stack consisting of **Remix** as the framework, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **shadcn/ui** for component design.

## Why This Project?

I wanted to create something that would:

1. Help me learn new technologies
2. Showcase my skills and projects
3. Express my interest in cybersecurity through a cyberpunk aesthetic
4. Serve as a personal playground for technical experimentation

The cyber theme aligns with my professional interests in tech and security, while giving me creative freedom to build something visually distinct.

## Portfolio Sections

The portfolio consists of several interconnected sections:

- **Dashboard**: The main hub with key information and navigation
- **Projects**: A showcase of my technical work and achievements
- **Blog**: Where I'll share technical write-ups and thoughts
- **Interactive Terminal**: A Debian-like terminal interface (currently under construction) with hidden information about me
- **Contact**: Ways to reach me for professional opportunities

## Coming Soon

In the coming weeks, I'll be publishing more content including:

- Technical articles about my projects, my tests
- Insights from my experiences
- Tutorials on cybersecurity topics
- Updates on this portfolio's development

This website represents my ongoing journey of learning and experimenting with web technologies alongside my professional work. It's a personal project built to keep my skills sharp and document my technical adventures. 

Feel free to explore all sections of the site, and check back regularly for new content ðŸ˜‰!
